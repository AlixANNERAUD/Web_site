Here is a list of my projects.
{{< /lead >}}

## {{< icon "palette-solid" >}} Personal

- {{< badge >}}Ongoing{{< /badge >}} [Xila](https://github.com/Xila-Project) : An operating system for microcontrollers. I'm currently rewriting a significant part of the codebase in Rust in order to make it more robust.

- {{< badge >}}Ongoing{{< /badge >}} Model railway network : Since 2019, I'm building a model railway network in [HO scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HO_scale) with [DCC control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Command_Control). The whole electronic part is designed by myself (signals, occupancy detection, etc.).

- [Connected speaker](https://github.com/AlixANNERAUD/Connected_speaker) : Designed a remote control system for a TDA7294 based amplifier card using off-the-shelf components and an ESP32, enhancing home entertainment with versatile audio control.

- [INSAgenda](https://insagenda.insa.lol/) : Contributed to friends project by developing a minor feature for a school agenda at INSA Rouen Normandie.
  
- I passionately advocate for data sovereignty and personally host and maintain a portion of my online services for myself, my family, and friends, including [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/), [Matrix](https://matrix.org/), [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/), [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/) and more.

## {{< icon "graduation-cap-solid" >}} School

- 2024 - [Evidential Occupancy Grid Map (EOGM)](https://github.com/AlixANNERAUD/Evidential_occupancy_map): Based on our professor's [research paper on pratical application of the Dempster-Shafer theory in robotics](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337171728_25D_Evidential_Grids_for_Dynamic_Object_Detection), we developed a real-time algorithm that creates maps of free and occupied spaces in a robot's environment using onboard LiDAR, IMU and GPS sensors.
It was developed for [Robot Operating System (ROS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Operating_System) in C++. 
It's fast and efficient due to various memory optimizations, vectorization and parallelization techniques. 

- 2024 - [ITI Adventure](https://github.com/AlixANNERAUD/ITI_aventure): A text-based role-playing game developed in Java to put object-oriented programming principles into practice.
 
- 2023 - [Huffman (de)compressor](https://github.com/AlixANNERAUD/Huffman_compressor) : A project where we have to develop a simple huffman (de)compressor in plain C.

- 2023 - [Robot mouche](https://github.com/AlixANNERAUD/Robot_Mouche) : A project where we have to design a robot  hat can either move freely thanks to a remote control over WiFi or follow a line and avoid obstacles using a LiDAR sensor and a camera.

- 2023 - [Music danceability](https://github.com/AlixANNERAUD/Music_danceability_prediction) : A data science team project where we had to predict the danceability of a song. We extracted data from the Spotify API. Developed in Python with Jupyter Notebook.

- 2022 - [INSAtram](https://github.com/AlixANNERAUD/INSAtram) : A managment game about a tramway network. Developed in Free Pascal with SDL 1.2.

- 2022 - [System of linear equations calculator](https://github.com/AlixANNERAUD/System_of_linear_equations_solver) for solving linear systems in plain C.
